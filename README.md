# QuickLocalizer
This application is based on the HackingWithSwift session of January 4th, 2025.  
Thank you to Paul Hudson for walking us through creating such an app.  
There are many features I would like to add overtime before releasing it on the appstore.
Note this code will be public, as it was freely shared during the Hacking With Swift sessions.

## ToDo Items
1. Create ability to read in an existing .xcstrings catalog.
2. Create a secondary window that displays a translation set of a selected language
